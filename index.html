            <p> Hello! I am a rising senior at MIT majoring in Mathematics (18) and Computer Science (6-3). I am interested in statistics and machine learning particularly in 
                statistical learning theory and interpretable machine learning as well as random matrix theory, high-dimensional statistics, and probability. </p>
